# Recipes App

The **Recipes App** is an Android application designed to be intuitive and a centralized platform for users to store, organize, and retrieve their recipes.

## Key Features

- **CRUD Operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**: Users can effortlessly add new recipes, complete with titles, ingredients lists, step-by-step instructions, and images to visually represent their culinary creations. The application also enables seamless editing and deletion of existing recipes, ensuring users maintain up-to-date and personalized collections.

- **Recipe Categorization**: Recognizing the importance of organization, the application allows users to categorize their recipes by meal types, such as "Breakfast," "Lunch," "Dinner," "Desserts," or any custom categories they choose. This feature facilitates quick and easy browsing and retrieval of recipes based on user preferences or meal planning needs.

- **Search Functionality**: To streamline recipe discovery, a robust search feature allows users to find recipes by either their titles or ingredients. This empowers users to quickly locate desired recipes, even within extensive collections.

- **Rating and Favorites**: Users can rate recipes based on their personal preferences and mark specific recipes as "favorites" for quick access. This feature enhances user engagement and provides a mechanism for users to highlight their most-loved recipes.

- **Local Data Persistence with Room Database**: To ensure data reliability and offline accessibility, the app employs Room Database, a powerful persistence library provided by Android, for storing recipe data locally on the user's device.
